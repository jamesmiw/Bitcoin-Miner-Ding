Bitcoin Miner "Ding" for Windows
by unfinishe

How to use:

1. In one cmd window, run your miner from the command-line, except add
	> output.txt 2>&1
to the end.

[miner] [options] > output.txt 2>&1

2. In another cmd window, run ding.exe followed by a word to look for.
ding.exe [word]

Here, ding.exe will show the output from your miner, 
and if it comes across [word] in the output, it will 
play the sound "ding.wav".

Enjoy!
